# Exploratory_Data_Analysis

## This is my first project while working at my previous job place. I analyzed a dataset from kaggle about unicorn companies around the world. A unicorn company, or unicorn startup, is a private company with a valuation of over $1 billion. As of June 2022, there are over 1,000 unicorns around the world. Popular former unicorns include Airbnb, Meta, and Google. Variants include a decacorn, valued at over $10 billion, and a hectocorn, valued at over $100 billion. The dataset contained 1061 unicorns and 10 columns which included information about company, valuation, date joined, country, city, industry, select founder, year founded, funding and financial stage.
